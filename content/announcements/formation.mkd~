# Announcing the North America Modelica Users' Group

Over the last few years, Modelica has spread dramatically beyond
Europe and is enjoying growing popularity in North America. In order
to address the issues that are often prevalent &ndash; and sometimes
unique &ndash; within North American industry and academia, the
North America Modelica Users&rsquo; Group has been established, with
the support of the Modelica Association.

    If you are a Modelica user or you are considering Modelica for your
    physical modeling projects, and work in North America then this is
    the ideal forum for exchanging ideas, addressing modeling problems
    and promoting the North American perspective within the Modelica
    Association.
